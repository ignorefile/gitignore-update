This tool is to update gitignore-gen's tpls.

You don't need to used this tool for most of the time, I will update the gitignore-gen repo.

But, if you find you need some tpls from github's repo badly, then you shuld try this.

# Usage

```
ignore-update src dst
```

# Notes

* The templates of gitignore file in gitignore-gen repo is come from  [GitHub's gitignore repo](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
* I will add more tpls for it in the future
